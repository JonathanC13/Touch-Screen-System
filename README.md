# Description

-	The project was a city mapping system to assist tourist to find locations that interested them. The system included an iOS application, web server, android application, and a touch screen kiosk.
-	My component of the project was to create the touch screen kiosk so tourists with no internet access may still use the application at these stationary kiosks.
-	The main deliverable was to design and implement the touch screen overlay for a monitor to enable touch. This included creating arrays of infrared emitter and receiver circuits to create the touch surface and using a Raspberry Pi and PiFace to control those circuits.
-	Hardware testing comprised of checking circuit completeness and analyzing output voltages. Software testing comprised of sending the intercepts calculated to a simulation for visual feedback.
-	Hosting the application for the kiosk only required emulating the android application on the Pi.

# End Remark

    The project was successful, grade wise and functionality, and I'm thankful for our supervisor for his support and my teammates' dedication to leading their systems through the whole 9 yards of development. My component's minimum viable product was missing a driver to select the co-ordinates on the Raspberry pi and looking back it's funny how bootleg my touch screen was.
    
    Thank you
